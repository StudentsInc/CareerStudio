              Youâ€™ve scored high in conscientiousness! This means you're a super
              organized, responsible, and reliable person. Think of it like
              being the captain of your own life - you've got a clear plan and
              you stick to it, no matter what obstacles come your way.
              Organization and tidiness bring you comfort and you prefer to have
              a clean and presentable bedroom, desk, or office. You value
              punctuality and try to arrive on time for important meetings,
              work, or school.
            </p>
            <p className="xl:mb-[3.25rem] mb-[3.25rem] text-white text-center w-[20rem] xl:w-auto -ml-20 xl:m-auto md:w-[48rem] font-[400] text-[0.94631rem] ">
              You're the kind of person who always has a backup plan. In fact,
              you probably have a backup plan for your backup plan. You're also
              the one your friends come to when they need help with a project
              because you're so reliable.
            </p>
            <p className="xl:mb-[3.25rem] mb-[3.25rem] text-white text-center w-[20rem] xl:w-auto -ml-20 xl:m-auto md:w-[48rem] font-[400] text-[0.94631rem] ">
              Some might call you a perfectionist, but really you just have a
              strong sense of responsibility and a desire to do your best. This
              can be a huge asset in both school and the real world, where
              staying on top of things is key to success. Just be careful not to
              get too caught up in the details - sometimes it's okay to let a
              little messiness slide, especially if it means having more time
              for fun and relaxation. You deserve it, conscientious one!
